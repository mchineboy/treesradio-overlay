# treesradio-overlay
## Overview
Since 1.0 is currently in development with a release date of "when it is done". I thought creating a Chrome Extension to enhance the current interface would be fun.
## Install
I have not released this to the Chrome Store yet. But will in December. Therefore you have to run it as a Chrome Developer Extension.
* browse to chrome://extensions
* Click on the check box for Developer Mode
* Download the CRX file, or clone the entire project.

### CRX Install
* Unzip the .crx file (its a zip file)
* In the chrome://extensions tab, click "load unpacked extension"
* Point it at the folder where you unzipped the CRX.
* You should see the TR pineapple in the extensions area of Chrome (same as url box)
* Refresh TreesRadio, and enjoy!

### Cloned project Install
* In the chrome://extensions tab, click "load unpacked extension"
* Point it at the subfolder in the project treesradio-overlay
* You should see the TR pineapple in the extensions area of Chrome (same as url box)
* Refresh TreesRadio, and enjoy!
